# config.example.yaml
# an example configuration for Turbo Wookie's backend.
# 
# config.yaml is used in two ways, to generate an mpd.conf file
# and to set some server configuation variables (such as domain, and port, 
# and MPD's port).

# Don't use quotes in the config.yaml

# what domain and port do you want Turbo Wookie to run on?
server_domain: localhost

# If MPD isn't in your path, change this to be the mpd executable's path

# what domain is MPD running on? You only need to change this if
# MPD is running on a different computer
mpd_domain: localhost

# What port is MPD outputting the stream to? Default is 8000
mpd_http_port: 8000

# What port is MPD listening for commands? Default is 6600
mpd_control_port: 6600

# Relative to Turbo Wookie's directory, where are MPD files being stored?
mpd_subdirectory: backend/mpd

# Relative to the MPD subdirectory, what are the paths of these files and 
# directories
